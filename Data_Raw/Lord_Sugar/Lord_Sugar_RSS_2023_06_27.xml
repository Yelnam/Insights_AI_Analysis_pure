<![CDATA[ Lord Alan Sugar looks to be losing favour with the BBC. We can reveal that for the last year, the channel has been secretly working on new ideas with Dragons' Den star Steven Bartlett. And one in development is set to rival Lord Sugar's business reality show, The Apprentice. A source tells us: "Steven's been developing a big new BBC One business entertainment format. "The BBC want him to be their next Alan Sugar and have been working on ic for over a year." In March, Apprentice candidate Amy Anzel launched a *" petition to ditch k Lord Sugar for the Den's youngest ever dragon. She wrote: "It's time to make way for the next generation before The Apprentice is run into the ground by people who have decided [it] should spend its time making a ockery of the candidates and damaging British entrepreneurship." Lord Sugar blocked Amy in response. i ]]>

<![CDATA[ AGE BLUNDER LED TO TEEN'S SWORD MURDER , / »** ACCOMPLICE Shergill "^J H * .,-'.. ' . »Staff didn't!»Blades were do proper ID j sold by Junior; check on killer j Apprentice star- VICTIM & MUM Devastated Pooja wants PM to toughen knife laws in the wake of Ronan's death 3* ,v. INVESTIGATES BY MARTIN FRICKER and MATTHEW DRESCH BUNGLING Post Office workers handed over a "zombie" sword to a 16-year-old who used it to murder a schoolboy hours later. Staff failed to check Prabjeet Veadhesa's ID when he collected the deadly parcel, which had been sent as an Age Verified item from a firm run by a former star of TV's Junior Apprentice. Instead, counter workers apparently assessed Veadhesa to be over 25 simply by looking at him. Veadhesa had bought the weapon, only on sale to over-18s, using his mother's ID and credit card. Hours after picking it up, he and Sukhman Shergill murdered Ronan Kanda, 16, in Wolverhampton, West Mids, after mistaking him for another teenager they were in dispute with Veadhesa dealing the fatal blows. It emerged during the trial that Veadhesa had bought 26 knives and swords from DNA Leisure in the previous six months using fake ID. He told the court he sold some on to fellow teens to "make money". After Veadhesa and Shergill got life sentences earlier this month, the family of tragic Ronan called for the post office in Walsall to be closed. "They just handed my son's killer the murder weapon," said mum Pooja. "He was a teenage boy, not an adult. How can kids be buying these weapons so easily? I want that Post Office to be shut down." CHECKS Veadhesa ordered the sword online from Luton-based DNA Leisure, run by Adam Eliaz. The 30-year-old was a contestant in the 2010 series of BBC show Junior Apprentice and was praised by Lord Sugar for his "enthusiasm". Mr Eliaz said his firm - which claims the swords are "like paintings" and also sells goods including knives and crossbows - paid for a Royal Mail Age Verification delivery. He said: "We comply with expert legal advice regarding our methods of sale. We perform age checks before orders are shipped and require the same at the point of delivery by our courier. If age verification is not performed at the time of delivery that is outside of our control." Royal Mail said: "The recipient requested to collect from their local Post Office. For age verified products, the Post Office is required to 'Challenge 25' and if the person looks under 25, check photo ID before the parcel is handed over. "It appears on this occasion the local Post Office did follow the 'Challenge 25' process but must have incorrectly assessed the person collecting the parcel looked over 25. We are following up with the Post Office to investigate." The Post Office said its branch in Walsall "was operated by a former retail partner" at the time of the killing, adding: 'An internal review involving the new retail operator is taking place." CCTV footage of Vead¬ hesa leaving the Post Office with the package was shown in his Wolverhampton crown court trial. Hours later, he sneaked up on aspiring lawyer Ronan and stabbed him yards from his home. Veadhesa and Shergill, both now 17, had mistaken him for someone else. DNA Leisure defended its right to sell zombie knives and swords, even comparing them with paintings. In a statement, it said: "We understand people are calling for larger knives and swords to be banned. We feel it's important to point out the purpose of these types of knives are essentially the same as paintings. "For many people they're collectable, it's a hobby that tens of thousands of people do safely and legally. It's already illegal to take most knives outside your home so further banning these types will have no discernible effect. "We always say, it's not a knife which makes a person a criminal - it's a criminal that turns a knife into a weapon. In this instance, we fulfilled our obligations to check and perform due diligence. Sadly, we are not able to prevent someone stealing an identity document from their parents." But Pooja, 46, said: "They sold the sword to my son's killer and have taken no responsibility. They are part of this and have done wrong." Veadhesa, of Walsall, was told he must serve at least 18 years and Shergill, of Willenhall, 16 years. Passing sentence, Mr Justice Choudhury slammed the "national scourge of knife crime" and the "ease with which lethal weapons can e obtained". He said: "It is disturbing a 16-year-old could so easily purchase such items online. Businesses jn engaged in this trade should reflect on their facilitation of knife crime." Pooja and Ronan's sister Nikita, 22, who are dedicating their lives to campaigning against knife crime, will launch a petition next week calling on the Government to do more to tackle the crisis. They want to meet PM Rishi Sunak to appeal to him to toughen laws. scoops® reachplc.com ,ne new leu How can kids be buying these weapons so easily? I want that Post Office to be shut down ]]>
